Feature: Define permissions for a category
  In order to be able to prevent some users from viewing some products
  As an administrator
  I need to be able to define permissions for categories

  Background:
    Given a "clothing" catalog configuration
    And I am logged in as "Peter"

  Scenario: Create category keeps the parent's permissions
    Given I am on the category "2014_collection" node creation page
    And I fill in the following information:
      | Code | newcategory |
    And I save the category
    When I edit the "newcategory" category
    And I visit the "Permissions" tab
    Then I should see the permission View products with user groups IT support, Manager and Redactor
    And I should see the permission Edit products with user groups IT support, Manager and Redactor
    And I should see the permission Own products with user groups IT support and Manager

  Scenario: By default, update children when the parent's permissions are changed
    Given the following categories:
      | code         | label-en_US   | parent    |
      | shoes        | Shoes         |           |
      | vintage      | Vintage       | shoes     |
      | trendy       | Trendy        | shoes     |
      | classy       | Classy        | shoes     |
    And I edit the "shoes" category
    And I visit the "Permissions" tab
    And I fill in the following information:
      | View products | Manager |
    And I save the category
    When I edit the "classy" category
    And I visit the "Permissions" tab
    Then I should see the permission View products with user groups Manager
