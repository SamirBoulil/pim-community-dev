    And I should not be able to view the "Edit attributes of the product" action of the row which contains "rangers"
    And I should not be able to view the "Classify the product" action of the row which contains "rangers"
    And I should not be able to view the "Delete the product" action of the row which contains "rangers"

  Scenario: Being able to view a product I can not edit
    Given I am on the products page
    And I should be able to access the show "boots" product page
    Then I should not be able to access the edit "boots" product page
    And I should be able to access the edit "rangers" product page
